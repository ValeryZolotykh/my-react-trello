# Trello Analog Application (React)
⏳ *october 2023 - january 2024*

## ▪️ Task
Development of a simplified version of Trello using React library. Provide the user with the ability to organize tasks and projects using boards, lists and cards.

## ▪️ Technologies and tools
- **Web Markup and Styling:** HTML5, CSS3.
- **Libraries:** React, Axios, Redux, react-toastify.
- **React:**  React Router, React Hooks (useForm, useState, useEffect, ,useRef), etc.
- **Development Tools:** Create React App, Eslint, Prettier.

## ▪️ What I did
- Development of React application for task and project management.
- Implementation of CRUD operations for boards, lists and cards.
- Update data after manipulation by users in real time.
- Integration with real API for saving and retrieving data.
- Implementation of Drag-n-Drop for cards (Vanilla JS by conditions of the task).
- Implementation of validation of data entered by the user.
- Implementation of a modal window for editing a card with the ability to add a description of the card.
- Implementation of a progress bar for the process of executing requests.
- Integration and configuration of react-toastify for pop-up notifications for the user after successful/unsuccessful data manipulation.
- Setup, configuration and build of the React project (Create React App, Eslint, Prettier)
- Demonstration of skills in working with the front-end library React and TypeScript.

## ▪️ Notes
Unlike the Angular version, some functionality has been added: a modal window with card editing and progress bar.

 **This project demonstrates my skills in developing React applications, implementing CRUD operations, ensuring real-time data updates, and integrating with external APIs. Additionally, it showcases advanced features such as Drag-n-Drop for cards, user data validation, modal window implementation for card editing with a description feature, and the inclusion of a progress bar enhances the user experience during the execution of requests.**
